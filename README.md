This project consisted of 6 projects that tested my knowledge of Data Structures.
Problem 1: Active Directory
This problem's task was to recursively check over a group to check whether this group had a certain group.
Checking all the groups part of the current group was vital because it needs to check every group to see if it's
the group that we are looking for.

Problem 2: Blockchain
This problem's task was to create a simple blockchain where each block stored information, 
its current hash code and the previous hash of the previous block.

Problem 3: File Recursion
This problem's task was to find all the files that ended in '.c' in a folder.

Problem 4: Huffman Encoding
This problem's task was to implement the compression algorithm; Huffman coding. Where given a string of data,
it needs to be converted into a smaller representation of it. There must be methods for encoding data and 
decoding the data.

Problem 5: LRU Cache
This problem required to create a data structure that performed all operations of: get/find, set/insert in O(1).
Where the least recently used item gets removed when we are at capacity.

Problem 6: Union and Intersection
This problem's task was to take two linked list and perform the union and intersection operations on them.
